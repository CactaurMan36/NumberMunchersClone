#Rules for the game

In all the Munchers games, the player controlled a green "Muncher" character across 

a grid of squares containing a short numerical or word expression. The objective 

is to consume all and only the grids containing information satisfying a specific

criterion (determined by the mode of play) while also avoiding the deadly dinosaur

monsters which roamed the grid.
